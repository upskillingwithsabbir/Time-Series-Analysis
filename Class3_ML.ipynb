    "*   **Process:** The Prophet model was instantiated with default yearly and weekly seasonality enabled. The data was formatted correctly (ds, y), and the model was fitted to the training data.\n",
    "*   **Prediction Failure:** An error occurred during the prediction phase: \"Length of values (241) does not match length of index (252)\". This mismatch likely happened because Prophet's `make_future_dataframe` with `freq='B'` (business days) generated a different number of dates than were present in the actual `test_ts` index over the same period (which might include holidays where the market was closed but Prophet predicted a value, or vice-versa). \n",
    "*   **Troubleshooting (for lecture):** This is a valuable teaching point about handling date indices carefully, especially when dealing with business day frequencies and potential holidays. Solutions could involve:\n",
    "    *   Ensuring the `future_dates` dataframe generated by Prophet perfectly aligns with the target test set index *before* prediction.\n",
    "    *   Using the test set's actual dates directly to create the `future_dates` dataframe instead of relying solely on `make_future_dataframe` with a frequency.\n",
    "    *   Post-processing the forecast to align it with the test index (e.g., reindexing).\n",
    "*   **Performance:** Due to the prediction error, RMSE and MAE could not be calculated for Prophet.\n",
    "*   **Components Plot (`plot_16_prophet_components.png`):** Although the forecast failed on the test set, the components plot generated from the training fit is still useful. It would typically show the overall trend detected by Prophet, as well as the estimated yearly and weekly seasonal patterns learned from the data. This helps in understanding the model's internal view of the time series structure."

    "*   **Process:** An XGBoost Regressor was used. Feature engineering was crucial, creating time-based features (day of week, month, year, etc.) and lag features (past values of the price) and rolling mean features.\n",
    "*   **Feature Engineering:** Lags (1, 5, 10, 21 days) and rolling means (5, 21 days) were created. It's important to create these on the full dataset before splitting to avoid lookahead bias within the training set, and then carefully split X and y. NaNs introduced by these features at the start of the training data were dropped.\n",
    "*   **Training:** The model was trained using early stopping based on a validation set (taken from the end of the training data) to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "*   **Performance (Test Set):**\n",
    "    *   RMSE: 53.3728\n",
    "    *   MAE: 50.9893\n",
    "*   **Interpretation:** The XGBoost model produced a forecast, but its performance (RMSE ~53.4, MAE ~51.0) was significantly worse than the simple ARIMA(1,1,1) model (RMSE ~35.0, MAE ~31.6) and the SARIMAX model (RMSE ~35.3, MAE ~31.9) on this test set. This highlights that more complex ML models are not automatically better for time series forecasting, especially with default settings or basic feature engineering. The performance heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the features created."
